# VS Ori: Definitive Edition and Spirit Purgatory
I have disabled issues because I won't be fixing anything, yea
I know there is a thing called "archived" but I'm still gonna
allow discussions and stuff.

This is the VS Ori Definitive Edition Source Code

You can see my horrible coding skills because this was a mod
that was worked on for 4 months and I still haven't
recode this mod lol.

And also me not knowing how to use git hub lmao
